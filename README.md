# QuantumVR
QuantumVR is a tool providing the technology and editors to easily compress virtual space. With this tool, you can create environments that contain potentially infinite amounts of space inside a finite space.

The goal of QuantumVR is to enable a new kind of room-scale VR experience, where players can explore vast environments just by using real walking.

Imagine a big, multi room virtual escape room for example. With QuantumVR, all rooms of the scenario fit inside the tracking space of the player, enabling him to walk freely through all rooms with no need for teleportation or other kinds of conservative locomotion approaches.

## Installation and dependencies
QuantumVR can be used with Unity 2019.2 or higher with the default core renderpipeline. 
To install it, just import the QuantumVR package and follow the instructions the tool provides during import to run the project setup.
